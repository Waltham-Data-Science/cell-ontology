# Annotation Properties

_Note- this page is currently under development._

The Cell Ontology has the following annotation properties:

Annotation property	| 	Description	|	Example term	|	Example annotation
-- | -- | -- | --
consider	|	To be used on obsoleted classes, to point to a term that should be considered by curators for use in place of the obsoleted term.  Multiple consider terms are allowed.  It can be useful to combine this with a comment to indicate when replacement would be appropriate.	|	CL:0000610 `obsolete plant cell`	|	PO:0009002
created_by	|	Coming soon	|	Coming soon	|	Coming soon
creation_date	|	Coming soon	|	Coming soon	|	Coming soon
database_cross_reference	|	Citable references that have helped generate the term and term's definition. Includes PubMed IDs (in the format PMID:XXXXXXXX).	|	CL:0011005 `GABAergic interneuron` | PMID:29724907
dc:contributor	|	Use this to annotate a whole ontology file with the identifier of a contributor.  ORCID preferred.	|	Coming soon	|	Coming soon
dc:creator	|	Value should be an orcid. Added automatically on term creation with standard Protege settings.	|	Coming soon	|	Coming soon
dc:date	|	Coming soon	|	Coming soon	|	Coming soon
dc:description	|	Coming soon	|	Coming soon	|	Coming soon
dc:title	|	Use this to annotate an ontology, giving it a human readable title.	|	Coming soon	|	Coming soon
dcterms:license	|	Use to attacha a license to an ontology	|	Coming soon	|	Coming soon
definition	|	Coming soon	|	Coming soon	|	Coming soon
'expand expression to'	|	Coming soon	|	Coming soon	|	Coming soon
foaf:depicted_by	|	Use this to add a link to an image that depicts an example of an entity referred to by the term	|	Coming soon	|	Coming soon
has_alternative_id	|	In CL this is a legacy property. Do not use.	|	Coming soon	|	Coming soon
has_broad_synonym	|	Used for synonyms where the primary definition accurately describes the synonym, but the definition of the synonym may encompass other structures as well. In some cases where a broad synonym is given, it will be a broad synonym for more than one ontology term.  You are encouraged to add a reference that uses the term in this way.	|	Coming soon	|	Coming soon
has_exact_synonym	|	Used for synonyms where the definition of the synonym is exactly the same as primary term definition. This is used when the same class can have more than one name.  You are encouraged to add a reference that uses the term in this way.  	|	Coming soon	|	Coming soon
has_narrow_synonym	|	Used for synonyms where the definition of the synonym is the same as the primary definition, but has additional qualifiers. You are encouraged to add a reference that uses the term in this way.	|	Coming soon	|	Coming soon
has_obo_namespace	|	This is a legacy annotation property.  Do not add this manually.	|	Coming soon	|	Coming soon
has_related_synonym	|	This scope is applied when a word of phrase has been used synonymously with the primary term name in the literature, but the usage is not strictly correct. That is, the synonym in fact has a slightly different meaning than the primary term name. Since users may not be aware that the synonym was being used incorrectly when searching for a term, related synonyms are included.	|	Coming soon	|	Coming soon
has_synonym_type	|	  The target of this relation must be an annotation property of type 'synonym_type_property'.	|	Coming soon	|	Coming soon
IAO_0000116	|	Coming soon	|	Coming soon	|	Coming soon
id	|	Automatically added by some pathways.  Do not add manually.  If duplicating a term (with the duplicate getting a new ID), it should be deleted.	|	Coming soon	|	Coming soon
in_subset	|	Coming soon	|	Coming soon	|	Coming soon
is_inferred	|	This annotation property is used in some automated pipelines.  Do not add manually	|	Coming soon	|	Coming soon
rdfs:comment	|	Use to add a clarifying comment to a term.  This can be useful for adding examples and for clarifying terminological confusions	|	Coming soon	|	Coming soon
rdfs:isDefinedBy	|	Do not add manually.	|	Coming soon	|	Coming soon
rdfs:label	|	Primary name - used as a display name by Protege (with standard settings) and most downstream consumers. Add only one of these.  It must be unique within an ontology.	|	Coming soon	|	Coming soon
RO_0002161	|	Coming soon	|	Coming soon	|	Coming soon
'see also'	|	Coming soon	|	Coming soon	|	Coming soon
shorthand	|	Added automatically by some pipelines.  Do not add manually	|	Coming soon	|	Coming soon
subset_property	|	Coming soon	|	Coming soon	|	Coming soon
synonym_type_property	| 	|	Coming soon	|	Coming soon
'term replaced by'	|	To be used on obsolete terms to indicate a term that can be automatically substituted for the obsoleted term. 	|	Coming soon	|	Coming soon
