# How to contribute to CL

We welcome your contributions to CL! Generally, you can follow the editors workflow instructions [here](odk-workflows/EditorsWorklow.md).

## Pull request guidelines

- Give your pull requests good names: `Add new terms` is bad. `Adding larval stage X term #332` is ok.
- Make sure pull requests have someone assigned to review them and remind them once in a while. Do not let them go dormant
- Assign yourself to be the Assignee
- Make sure to use `- [ ]` to denote action items in issues and pull requests, not just comments. These turn into checkboxes which makes it much faster to assess which comments have been addressed and can be ignored.
- Give a short summary of the pull request - that way we can find suitable reviewers much quicker. Say which terms you are adding or what kinds of changes you are proposing.
- It is most of the time a good idea to use `squash merge` rather than `merge` for your pull request, to keep the git history short and useful.
