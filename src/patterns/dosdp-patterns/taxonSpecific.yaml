description: A cell that is restricted to a specific taxon, such as CL:0001200 'lymphocyte of B lineage, CD19-positive' are only in mammals. Note - this is not to be used for any cell that is restricted to a taxon, this is for taxon-specific subclasses of existing cell types. This should hardly ever be used.
